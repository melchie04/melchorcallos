  name: "Melchor Bendanillo Callos",
  roles: "Website Developer / Software Tester",
  description: "I studied and took a bachelor's degree in information technology at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines from 2014 to 2018. I work as a software tester, specializing in automation testing. I also have expertise in white-box and functional testing. Programming is my passion, and I'm always looking to improve my skills. I love developing websites because it allows me to create functional and user-friendly solutions while honing my programming abilities. Plus, there's nothing quite like the sense of accomplishment that comes from building something that people find useful!"
